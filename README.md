## Project Overview

Meeting Summarizer is a **full-stack web application** designed to reduce the effort of manually writing meeting minutes. Users can input or upload meeting transcripts, and the system uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to generate meaningful summaries.

The project demonstrates the **end-to-end workflow** of an AI application — from text processing to deployment on a modern cloud platform.
